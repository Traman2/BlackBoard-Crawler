A: The extension works with any institution that uses the standard Blackboard Learn platform. If you encounter issues with your specific institution, please open an issue. Adjust the domain names in the background and content scripts from utdallas to your unviersity of choice.

A: Currently, the extension supports Google Calendar integration and CSV export. The CSV file can be imported into most calendar applications. The Google Calendar sync feature only works when using the ElevAIte portal

A: The extension only scrapes course information, assignment details, and due dates from your Blackboard dashboard. Future plans are to also scrape the grades feature. If you'd like, you can fork this repository, add any features you like, and submit a pull request. 

**Q: I'm getting an error when trying to scrape data. What should I do?**
